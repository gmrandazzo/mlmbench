# MLMBench - MachineLearning Molecular Benchmarch
This repository collects datasets and splits to do benchmark 
over different ML algorithms and data representations.

The scope of this code is to keep a simple API representation
without the need for external libraries and keep the
dataset representation in a widely supported format such as CSV (RFC 4180 standard).
